### About the code.
For my Assignment, I choose to write the code in Haskell. I used ghc and ghci on a unix enviroment to run and test my code. All my solutions to the each question are in *Assignment1.hs*. Below are specifications of what I used to code for the assignment. 

### Documentation
All my code is documented. I give a brief summary on the function created and then give a rule set
### Specifications
- ghc - version 8.0.1
- ghc mod
- Test.HUnit - Haskell's test unit
- Data.List library

The Test unit is used in *testing.hs*

### Notes:
I originally used Doubles to cover all numbers however due to ucpu1 ghc it would note allow me to run doubles for my enviroment.
Although It ran perfectly fine on my linux computer code commented out cause of ucpu1
-- transform :: Query -> Env -> Double
-- type Env = [(Var, Double)]
